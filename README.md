# EcoElevate

## 💡 Inspiration

The problem addressed by these initiatives is the negative impact of human activities on the environment, particularly through the emission of greenhouse gases and the consumption of non-renewable resources. By providing daily tips for sustainable living and a free tool to calculate their carbon footprint, people can become more aware of their impact on the environment and take action to reduce it. Additionally, by offering daily tips to reduce their carbon footprint and a marketplace to buy green energy products, individuals can make sustainable choices that have a positive impact on the environment. The problem statement is thus the need to increase awareness about sustainable living practices and offer accessible and practical solutions to reduce carbon footprint and promote sustainability.
